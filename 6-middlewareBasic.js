// Express Middleware are functions that execute during request to the server.
// Each middleware function has access to request and response object.
/**
 * Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req),
 *  the response object (res), and the next function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle.
 *  The next function is a function in the Express router which, when invoked,
 *  executes the middleware succeeding the current middleware.
 
 * Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:

Execute any code.
Make changes to the request and the response objects.
End the request-response cycle.
Call the next middleware in the stack.
